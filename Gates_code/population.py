    Make the cells for the simulation.

    Usually called via ``sim.initialize()``.

    Args:
        sim      (Sim)  : the simulation object; population parameters are taken from the sim object
        popdict  (any)  : if supplied, use this population dictionary instead of generating a new one; can be a dict or Cells object
        reset    (bool) : whether to force population creation even if self.popdict/self.people exists
        verbose  (bool) : level of detail to print

    Returns:
        cells (CellMass): Cell
